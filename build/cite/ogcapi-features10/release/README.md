This is an extract of the [release](../../../../data/release/) data directory
without the raster layers and their corresponding datasets, for the purpose
of executing the ogcapi-features-1.0 conformance test suite against this
well known datasets.

Note although it adds the shapefiles and geopackage again, they won't incur
in any size overhead for the repository given the way git stores files.
