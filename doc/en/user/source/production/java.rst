Java Considerations
===================

Use supported JRE
-----------------

GeoServer's speed depends a lot on the chosen Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The latest versions of GeoServer are tested with both Oracle JRE and OpenJDK. Implementations other than those tested may work correctly, but are generally not recommended.

Tested:

* Java 17 - GeoServer 2.22.x and above (OpenJDK tested, experimental only)
* Java 11 - GeoServer 2.15.x and above (OpenJDK tested)
* Java 8 - GeoServer 2.9.x to GeoServer 2.22.x (OpenJDK and Oracle JRE tested)
* Java 7 - GeoServer 2.6.x to GeoServer 2.8.x (OpenJDK and Oracle JRE tested)
* Java 6 - GeoServer 2.3.x to GeoServer 2.5.x (Oracle JRE tested)
* Java 5 - GeoServer 2.2.x and earlier (Sun JRE tested)

.. Further speed improvements can be released using `Marlin renderer <https://github.com/bourgesl/marlin-renderer>`__ alternate renderer.

As of GeoServer 2.0, a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is sufficient to run GeoServer.  GeoServer no longer requires a Java Development Kit (JDK).

Running on Java 17
----------------------------------

GeoServer is compatible with Java 17, but requires extra care for running in some environments.

Deployment on Tomcat 9.0.55 has been tested with success.

GeoServer code depends on a variety of libraries trying to access the JDK internals. 
It does not seem to matter when running as a web application. However, in case of need, 
here is the full list of opens used by the build process::

   --add-exports=java.desktop/sun.awt.image=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.text=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.desktop/java.awt.font=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.desktop/sun.awt.image=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.naming/com.sun.jndi.ldap=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.desktop/sun.java2d.pipe=ALL-UNNAMED

Running on Java 11
------------------

GeoServer 2.15 and above will run under Java 11 with no additional configuration on **Tomcat 9** or newer and **Jetty 9.4.12** or newer.

Running GeoServer under Java 11 on other Application Servers may require some additional configuration. Some Application Servers do not support Java 11 yet.

* **Wildfly 14** supports Java 11, with some additional configuration - in the run configuration, under VM arguments add:

      --add-modules=java.se

  Future WildFly releases should support Java 11 with no additional configuration.

* **GlassFish** does not currently Java 11, although the upcoming 5.0.1 release is expected to include support for it.

* **WebLogic** do not yet support Java 11.
