Check out source code
---------------------

Check out the source code from the git repository.::

   git clone https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver.git geoserver

To list the available branches.::

  % git branch
     2.21.x
     2.22.x
   * main

Choose ``main`` for the latest development.::

  % git checkout main

Or choose a stable branch for versions less likely to change often::

  % git checkout 2.22.x

In this example we will assume that your source code is in a directory called ``geoserver``, but a more descriptive name is generally recommended.
